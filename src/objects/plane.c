	@function
	Intersect_plane will caculate if there is an intersection, if it does have,
	then save the intersection into *t, for other functions to use.

	@ The intersection between a ray and a plane is calculated using the
	following formula:
	1. Ray Equation: P(t)=O+tD
		O: ray origin;
		D: ray direction;
		t: Parameter representing the distance from the origin to the
		   intersection point;
	2. Plane euqation: N⋅(P−P0)= 0
		N: plane normal vector;
		P0: A point on the plane;
		P: Any point on the plane.
	3. Intersection formula: t= N * (P0 - O) / (N * D)
	if N * D = 0, the ray is parallel to the plane and there is no intersection.

	Because the shape is plane, so if there are intersections, it will be just
	one.

	@return value
	-1: when there are no intersections or intersection is behind of the light
	t: when there is a intersection.
