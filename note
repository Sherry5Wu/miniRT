Process:
-validate
-set up the scene
-generate 3d objects
-set camera position
-calculate lighting
-calculate colours
-render the scene

I will try to build a simple version that creates just one object in a scene without any input or lighting first. Then it will be easier to start building different functions on top of that.

What it does currently:
-initialises the window, can exit by clicking the cross
-Sets static object values
-Sets camera location, doesn't actually handle orientation in rendering
-renders a sphere object based on it's coordinates with flat colour value

functions needed:
-Receive a .rt file as input and convert the text read from that into the values of the cameras, lights, objects.
-Change the colour of each pixel depending on the distance from the camera in order to show depth.
-Ambient lighting and other lights
-Generation of cylinder and plane objects
-Improve the camera functionality, it's currently static on the X,Y axis
